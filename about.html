        <span class="e1_59">Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, 
                            the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical 
                            rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous 
                            population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was 
                            dominated by fishing or agriculture. </span>
